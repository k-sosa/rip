This website was a group project with k-sosa, Blinkjuan82, ahaymond-dev and SenyorPencil.

Our windows 98 website theme was inspired by Blinkjuan82. And we think it also goes with the whole idea of our page, which is a little dark. We have a functional register and sign in pages that creates a unique username for our users. The usernames and passwords are stored in a mySQL database. The user can search for missing people in the United Stated and chat with other users about them. If they think the person is dead they make a post about them. This was supposed to be the part of our assignment where we built our server side API. We faced a lot of challenges doing this and our post is not successful at the moment. 

For the chat room we use an npm package called socket io. 
For the death post that people are supposed to use we also use express-fileupload to uplaod a picture.
